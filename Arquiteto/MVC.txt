MVC is a software architecture - the structure of the system - that separates domain/application/business (whatever you prefer) logic from the rest of the user interface. It does this by separating the application into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller.

The model manages fundamental behaviors and data of the application.
The view effectively provides the user interface element of the application.
The controller receives user input and makes calls to model objects and the view to perform appropriate actions.
